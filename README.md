## Iris Flower Classification

In [main.py](main.py), the ELM algorithm is implemented to tackle a task such as Iris flower classification. 
ELM proposed a concept called Single-hidden Layer Feedforward Network (SFLN).
This network is simply a network with only an input layer, a hidden layer, 
and an output layer. 

## SFLN

SFLN can be written mathematically as:
